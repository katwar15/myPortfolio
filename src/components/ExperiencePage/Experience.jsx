          Throughout my career, I have had several accomplishments across
          various domains. I have authored scientific articles as well as
          articles about design. Moreover, I was a Ph.D. student and taught
          students about new media and feminism. Additionally, I have worked as
          an editor for a humanities magazine. I have also created a brand and
          learned about UX and UI design. Later, I learned how to code to bring
          my ideas to life. All of this experience has helped me to think
          broadly and unconventionally.

After years of studying, lecturing, and writing articles for some of the most important magazines in Poland, I realized that I wanted a career that combined my desire to create with my sociological-psychological flair. That's why I chose UX/UI design, which brings together these two elements. I also added frontend development to my skillset so that I could seamlessly incorporate ideas from Figma into the code",

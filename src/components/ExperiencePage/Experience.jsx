          Throughout my career, I have had several accomplishments across
          various domains. I have authored scientific articles as well as
          articles about design. Moreover, I was a Ph.D. student and taught
          students about new media and feminism. Additionally, I have worked as
          an editor for a humanities magazine. I have also created a brand and
          learned about UX and UI design. Later, I learned how to code to bring
          my ideas to life. All of this experience has helped me to think
          broadly and unconventionally.
